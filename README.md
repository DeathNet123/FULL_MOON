# FULL_MOON
I am Arslan Iftikhar and I am Computer Scientist and this repo contains all of the my non-sense durign my university life.<br>
So right now i am student at PUCIT and I created this repo so that i can put all of my junk in one place instead of creating different repo.<br>
I know i could have created the local directory but i choose to create the this bulk so people can enjoy my code and laugh if i have done something funny.<br>
I know i will do something funny i am coding since i was in grade 10 and i know we all make horrible mistakes so you can both laugh and learn from my mistakes.<br>
I am not promising but I will try to write one article a month.<br>
If you find any issue in the code feel free to create issue.
